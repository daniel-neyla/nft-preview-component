## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned


the <article> element 
```html
<article></article>
```

You can center a div inside the body element by using this css:
```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```

Using `rem` and `em` instead of `px`




### Continued development
Making website responsive to varies screen sizes
